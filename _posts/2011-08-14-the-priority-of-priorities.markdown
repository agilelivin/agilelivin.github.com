**Content:** Change happens and estimates go awry, yet here we are more or less on time and on budget with the the third iteration of Agilelivin. Listen in on the conversation with Philipp and Steve as they talk about the priority of priorities--and the habit of setting habits. As our favourite scrum coach likes to say, "If you don't know where you're going, that's where you're going to end up."  To which we add, "If you're going there by bike, wear a helmet."
