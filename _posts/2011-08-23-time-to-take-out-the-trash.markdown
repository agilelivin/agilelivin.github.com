summary: Steve and Philipp turn their attention to the ubiquitous To-Do list as a tool for tackling procrastination. While Philipp is one of those guys who thrives on a long (but not overly complicated) To-Do list, Steve can just about handle a Scrum Board and may adapt the 3+2 rule for task tracking.  The two debate the merits of their respective styles, and the only thing they agree on is that at some point you just gotta make sure you take out the trash.

**Content:** Steve and Philipp turn their attention to the ubiquitous "To-Do" list as a tool for tackling procrastination. While Philipp is one of those guys who thrives on a long (but not overly complicated) "To-Do" list, Steve can just about handle a Scrum Board and may adapt the 3+2 rule for task tracking.  The two debate the merits of their respective styles, and the only thing they agree on is that at some point you just gotta make sure you take out the trash.
